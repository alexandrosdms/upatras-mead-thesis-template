abstract = {Planning algorithms are impacting technical disciplines and industries around the world, including robotics, computer-aided design, manufacturing, computer graphics, aerospace applications, drug design, and protein folding. Written for computer scientists and engineers with interests in artificial intelligence, robotics, or control theory, this is the only book on this topic that tightly integrates a vast body of literature from several fields into a coherent source for teaching and reference in a wide variety of applications. Difficult mathematical material is explained through hundreds of examples and illustrations.},
annote = {Semi-algebraic models are not critical for Sampling Based Motion Planning

Sections 3.2 and 3.3 are critical

Section 3.4 applies to more compicated stuctures
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single Query techniques -> They integrate sampling with descrete planning (i.e., searching) techniques.},
